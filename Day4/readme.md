# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python. The game prompts the user to choose between rock, paper, and scissors. The computer then makes a random choice, and the game determines the winner based on standard rules.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.2

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.12.2 installed on your system.

## Project Files

- **main.py**: Contains the main code for the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
- **art.py**: Contains the ASCII art for rock, paper, and scissors.
- **README.md**: You're currently reading it! It provides information about the project.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py` file and `art.py` (containing the ASCII art) are located.
3. Run the following command:
    ```
    python main.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors):
   - Type "rock", "paper", or "scissors" when prompted.
   - The computer will randomly select its choice.
5. The program will display both your choice and the computer's choice, followed by the result of the game:
   - If both choices are the same, it's a tie.
   - Rock beats scissors.
   - Scissors beat paper.
   - Paper beats rock.

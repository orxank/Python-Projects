# Hangman Game

## Description
This is a simple Python implementation of the classic Hangman game. The player tries to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of guesses. The game displays the progress with each guess and ends when the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.2

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.12.2 installed on your system.

## Project Files
- **main.py**: Contains the main code for the Hangman game.
- **word_list.py**: Contains the list of words used in the game.
- **stages.py**: Contains the stages of the hangman and ASCII art.
- **art.py**: Contains the logo and other art for the game.
- **README.md**: You're currently reading it! It provides information about the project.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py`, `word_list.py`, `stages.py`, and `art.py` files are located.
3. Run the following command:

4. Follow the prompts to play the game:

# Caesar Cipher

## Description
This is a simple Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The user can encode or decode a message by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a specified number of positions. The program prompts the user for the type of operation (encode or decode), the message, and the shift amount, then performs the requested operation and displays the result.

## Requirements
- Python 3.12.2

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.12.2 installed on your system.

## Project Files
- **main.py**: Contains the main code for the Caesar Cipher.
- **alphabet.py**: Contains the list of alphabet letters used in the cipher.
- **art.py**: Contains the ASCII art logo for the project.
- **README.md**: You're currently reading it! It provides information about the project.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the `main.py`, `alphabet.py`, and `art.py` files are located.
3. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
4. Follow the prompts to use the Caesar Cipher:
   - Type 'encode' to encrypt a message or 'decode' to decrypt a message.
   - Enter the message you want to encode or decode.
   - Enter the shift number (the number of positions to shift the letters).
   - The program will display the encoded or decoded message.

## Logo
The ASCII art logo used in this project was created using the following online tool:
